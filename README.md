Counterfeit Medicines Sales Prediction

Problem statement:
------------------

Counterfeit medicines are fake medicines which are either contaminated or contain wrong or no active
ingredient. They could have the right active ingredient but at the wrong dose. Counterfeit drugs are illegal and
are harmful to health. 10% of the world's medicine is counterfeit and the problem is even worse in developing
countries. Up to 30% of medicines in developing countries are counterfeit.

Millions of pills, bottles and sachets of counterfeit and illegal medicines are being traded across the world. The
World Health Organization (WHO) is working with International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) to dislodge
the criminal networks raking in billions of dollars from this cynical trade.

Despite all these efforts, counterfeit medicine selling rackets donâ€™t seem to stop popping here and there. It has
become a challenge to deploy resources to counter these; without spreading them too thin and eventually
rendering them ineffective. Government has decided that they should focus on illegal operations of high net
worth first instead of trying to control all of them. In order to do that they have collected data which will help them
to predict sales figures given an illegal operation's characteristics.



Initial proposal for solution:
------------------------------
* Initially tried with Linear Regression but the r2_score was very less.
* Later tried with Random Forest.


Performance:
------------
* Random Forest gave an r2_score of .52 .
